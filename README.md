# File Comparison Tool

This is a simple program that compares two text files and prints whether they are identical or lists the differences if they are not.

## Usage

Run the program from the command line by passing two filenames as arguments:

```bash
python compare.py path/to/file1.txt path/to/file2.txt
```

### Output

If the files are identical, the program will print:

```
The files are identical.
```

If the files are not identical, the program will print the differences, with a few carriage returns between the file1 and file2 output to visually line them up.
